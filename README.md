## Branch 1: Substring Extraction

In the first branch, the script parses the log file by splitting or extracting substrings. This method is implemented using string manipulation techniques and is useful for simple log formats.

## Branch 2: Regex Parsing

The second branch of the script utilizes regular expressions (Regex) for parsing the log file. This method is more powerful and flexible, allowing for complex pattern matching and extraction of specific information from the log.
